Fitness Tracker


## Description
A consumer will reach their fitness goals quicker when they track their workout progress.


## What does the app do?
As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

## How does it work?
The application  will be invoked with the following command:

```sh
nodemon server.js
```

## Technologies
Node, HTML, CSS, Javascript

## Languages, frameworks, various tools
This application uses Node packages Express, FS, PATH and MySQL.

## Challenges
Knowing to put the wildcard (*) route at the end of all the routes otherwise none of the routes would work.

## Your experience building this app


## What was difficult

Heroku is pretty cool.
For me: Look in Week 11, 04-Supplemental for instructions on how to set up Heroku url
